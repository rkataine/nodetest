    ”It’s like five-dimensional chess against the world” - Mark Cuban

    <p>
        League of Legends, as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena">MOBA</a>, is a game bit like chess. But instead of playing solo the player, as a
        member of team of five, competes against other. As in chess, the board / map is basically always the same.
        However, the variation of pieces in League of Legends is significantly bigger – 134 different at the moment
        and new ones are released constantly.
    </p>
    <p>
        In LoL there is the blue and the red team. Game is over once other team manages to infiltrate other team’s
        base in the other opposite corner of the map or if other team surrenders. One game takes 40 minutes on
        average. The winner is mostly decided by which team works better as a unit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alongside computer game League of Legeds is also an e-sport in which players compete
        professionally. In the end of each season new official world champion is crowned and one team hoists the
        hard-earned summoner’s cup. The culture as a whole is today a huge business and as an e-sport, the market
        of future.

    <h2 id="Beginning">THE BEGINNING</h2>
    <p>
        At 90’s the internet had become commodity which brought casual gamers together. Until this computer and console games had been mostly for individuals or shared by friends but now
        it was suddenly possible to chain many computers and play games with multiple players. This was the first step on way to global gaming and playing with total starngers / anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ancestor of MOBA genre is real-time strategy. In these games player would build a base which enabled production and commanding of small armies used for defeating enemy’s
        equivalent. Well known first examples are Dune and Command&Conquer games.

    </div>

    <p>
    <h3>WARCRAFT 3</h3>
    <p>
        Warcraft, by Blizzard, was as well real-time strategy in the
        ancient fantasy world of orcs and humans. The third part
        of the series was the first of it’s kind by introducing the consept
        of unique champions as leaders of the armies. They were the
        strongest units in game and at least as important as the rest
        of armies themselves.
    </p>

    <h3>MODING & DOTA</h3>
    <p>
        In many games, as well as in Warcraft 3, there had been community-based modes of games for which gamers
        themselves customized differents setups and rules. Among community a mod called Defender of the
        Ancients (DotA) gathered(?) fast a lot of attention and dedication and in the end grew almost as popular
        as Warcraft 3 itself. In it players control only the champion as a team of five.
    </p>

    <h3>RIOT OF GAMES</h3>
    <p>
        Riot Games was founded in 2006. The small company consisted of gaming enthusiasts of which some
        had been previously working for Blizzard. League of Legends, closely based on DotA, was officially released
        late 2009 in north america and europe got it’s own server soon afterwards. Despite of moderately bad visuals
        it managed to hook people being fun. At the time of release there was total of 42 champions. Season 1
        started at 2010.
    </p>

    <h3>DREAMHACK 2011</h3>

    <div class="clearfix" style="float:right;width:35%">

        <br/><br/><br/>
    </div>

    <p>
        At the time culture of competitive gaming was based on big collective and commercial LAN parties all around
        the world. Huge group of people related to gaming or the industry gathered under the same roof to share the
        same passion. During these the unofficial championships of many different games were dicided.
    </p>
    <p>
        League of Legends’ first final tournament of season was staged(?) at Dreamhack 2011 in Jönköping
        Sweden. It was still relatively unknown game and the competition consisted only of north american and
        european amateur teams.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was clash of two different playstyles and the most succesful one has prevailed so basically until today.
        On the contrary of what was anticipated by most there was two european teams in the finals in which Fnatic
        took the victory over AgainstAllAuthority. The event was really small-scale and maybe not more than hundred
        people were fitnessing the finals on spot.
    </p>

<div class="white_back">
    <h2 id="What_we_know">WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR</h2>
    <p>
        Riot had decided to invest into esports. Even though the time was too young for bigger markets it started the era of professional global competition. Season 2 was about to end with
        world championships. Suddenly there was a lot more organisations and also Asia, as anticipated joined in.
    </p>

    <img src="images/overview_3.1.png" style="width:80%;height:auto;float:left; margin-left:10%" />
    <br/><br/><br/>

    <h3>SEASON 2 - THE GAME EVOLVES</h3>
    <p>
        The general strategy was set and it started to evolve getting more diverse. Small over-continental rivalries began to build and the foundations for culture had been laid.
    </p>
    <p>
        There was yet no organized competition structure and the time before worlds was about LAN-parties. Outside of the best of Dreamhack russian team Moscow5 ended up dominating
        the season.
        They emerged from somewhere and suddenly it seemed there wasn’t any serious contenders. Their oppressive strategies took long time from others to figure how to counter and nowadays
        the game is played as they innovated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most probably thought M5 was about to storm the World Championships although asian teams, koreans in front had started to show serious improvement. However their journey ended
        at semifinals by Taipei Assassins who showerd their own version of the game instead. This led eventually to finals and victory over korean Azubu Frost and of tournament, million dollars
        and the summoner’s cup.

    <h3>KOREA</h3>
    <p>
        The birthplace of esports is South Korea / Seoul. It’s firstborn Starcaft: Broodwar grew to
        be enough popular the first real stardoms popping up as well. This all lasted years and
        is still today somehow alive. The reasons for it’s decay are complex but after it League
        of Legends was to be the new big thing. Their history and experience of competitive
        gaming was about to show.
    </p>
    <h3>SEASON 3 - THE PRODIGY</h3>
    <p>
        The year launched the official leagues of pro gaming on many different regions. During
        the year all eyes were already on Korea but on last half new team of rising rookies SKT
        T1, led by prodigy known as Faker broke into local scene ending up winning it.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the time of world championships asian teams were previewed(?) top seeded. Only
        this time China had arosed to be a serious powerhouse and contender of Korea and in
        the finals there were one team from both. Eventually chinese Royal Club, led by their
        brightest star Uzi got dismantled 3-0 by Fakers squad.
    </p>
    <h3>SEASONS 4-6 - THE REIGN</h3>
    <p>
        Due to overwhelming performance other regions start their chase by studying the
        differences. Soon it becomes clear that it’s not only about the game itself but also all
        the other things around it including already existing infrastructure and own national
        association for esports. Their training was professional as well having own coaches
        and analysts which was unheard for others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Season 4 had it’s final tournament held finally in Korea / Seoul and first time out of US.
        It was rough year for SKT T1 failing to participate Worlds at all and at the time of it all
        were talking about ”the perfect team” – Samsung White. The final itself almost filled
        Seoul olympic stadium with 40,000 people witnessing the spectacle in which the replay
        of previous year took place. This time Uzi with Star Horn Royal Club had to admit korean
        SSW better by 3-1. The gap was closing. :)
    </p>
    <p>
        Next offseason started by ”korean exodus” - players were purchased from korea as
        imports stacking all the other regions, especially China. For them it was going to be
        a great year them having now all the best talent. Except Faker. The season 5 final
        tournament took place in Europe. China failed miserably but this time european teams
        hold their ground placing two teams in semis against korean counterparts but in the
        end the final was between latter. SKT T1 beat KOO Tigers 3-1 being the first team and
        having first players (Faker and Bengi) to win twice. Fully korean finals told something
        else about the gap.
    </p>
    <p>
        6th season was about ”EUxodus” them moving especially to NA. Also the time was ripe
        for big markets and venture capitalists to jump in the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
        In official international mid year event (MSI) Europe plummeted though NA showed
        surprisingly strong but int the end was overcome by koreans. Despite the result happening
        showed promising rest of the year for others.
    </p>
    <p>
        This was the first year the reigning champions managed to participate on next year’s
        championships bringing SKT T1 back to US. It was supposed to be the tightest tournament
        for years and it started well by even wild card teams winning some games. What
        happened though was that three out of 4 teams in semis were koreans one euroapean
        team as their brake. Fully korean finals showed the gap was there and about to stay by
        SKT T1, Faker and Bengi taking their third titles against Samsung Galaxy. The reign
        continues...

    <p>
        The history of the game and culture is still quite brief. The ongoing year is officially 
        season 7 and for the time being (2017) it’s the biggest computer game of the planet.
    </p>    
    <p>
        The game by numbers:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>100,000 concurrent players within two months of launch</li>
        <li>season one championship suprisingly collected over 100,000 simultaneous viewers</li>
        <li>at 2014 67 million active players each month</li>
        <li>season 5 championship reached roughly 334 million unique viewers over the course</li>
        <li>depending on source, at 2016 it has more than 100 million active gamers each month</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Broadcasting is done by internet’s streaming services (such as Twitch / Youtube etc.). 
        This is mainly because this way the culture is not dependant of TV air times or schedules 
        and can produce any amount of content. At the same time it’s not only about the 
        competition anymore. There are huge amount of casual players and former pros who make 
        their living by streaming LoL. Addition to this there is also a lot of other serious 
        career paths related to the culture nowadays – coaches, analysts, casters and artists 
        few to mention. As the big markets joined it has became clear that the game itself wasn’t 
        going anywhere, at least for a while. It’s not just a game anymore but more of a movement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then why is League of Legends so popular as it is? It’s still unclear but maybe has something 
        to do with being really fast and actionpacked game which has low skill floor but remarkably high 
        ceiling, amazing diversity, incredibly rewarding combat system and cameramode which is same 
        for players and spectators, few to mention. New patches have been released regularly keeping 
        the game in ongoing change.
